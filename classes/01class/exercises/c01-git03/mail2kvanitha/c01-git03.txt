## Questions (answer inline)

1. Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
The size of the Git repo increases as it contains entire version history. Big File increases the clone and fetch times for other users of a repository. Also, git may throw error during git push.


2. What is the reason for this problem?
Git large files can take up large memory and hence will throw out of memory errors.

3. How do you remove something from Git history after it is pushed to the remote repository? Which commands would you use? 
To remove file from local repository, use git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-To-FILE" HEAD
TO remove the file from Remote Repository "git push origin --force --all"

4. What are the consequences of the previous action?
IF the repository is very big, it will take more time as this command need to search the entire repository before deleting changes.
