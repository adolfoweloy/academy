## Answers

1. Is it possible to see the inner commit of squashed commit with `git rebase`?
Git makes log of all the commits and hence can move around the squashed commit using "git rebase -i option"
```


```

2. How to compare two different local repositories using `git diff`? How about remote ones, can you do the same?
Two different local repositories can be compared using 
git diff <local_path1> <local_path2>

The same can be applied between local and remote branches, using
git diff <master> <origin/master>

I think git fetch <source:destination> helps to compare between origin(source) and local repository (destination).
```
